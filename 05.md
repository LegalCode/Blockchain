# Proposed Definition 05: 
A smart contract is a business logic agreement formalized and made binding using the instrument of software code, with the purpose of facilitating legal agreements in whole or in part, through any of execution, enforcement or remedy	

## Reasons and Context for this Proposal: 
The strongest disconnect in my view between smart contracts and legal contracts is the context in which they are described. Contracts are well known. They serve a purpose, in which they facilitate binding agreements between named parties, have emergent elements of meeting of the minds, consideration, etc. There are rigorous mechanisms for remedy and enforcement, as well as mitigating circumstances that have stood the test of time. Contracts are the ongoing ebb and flow of human needs, shaped into a system that works for human requirements. If we started from scratch, it is likely that similar definitions of contracts would arise, since they just mirror back to us humans what is and is not needed for agreement to work.

Their drawbacks are the friction costs of the legal system (inefficient, expensive, slow) and the seemingly arbitrary nature of state power and its often ""wrong"" decisions, depending on your context. Smart contracts can solve the first but not the second problem. Putting aside the techno-utopian argument of a post-state world, smart contracts need to exist in the legal ecosystem. Developers have coopted the word ""contract"" and put it into the label ""smart contract"". Invoking the law does not bestow the subject with legal meaning, and does not put it into the context of human history without some thought. Thus the current implementation of smart contracts on the blockchain lacks judgment by definition and by exclusion, ignoring the idea that agreement can be uncertain, undefined and fuzzy. The DAO hack is the obvious example--we humans did not have a meeting of the minds with the software, because we did not understand the software. Code is not real law between humans, it is merely an instrument.

In my definition, I try to connect the two concepts. Smart contracts are business logic. Derivatives, insurance, etc all are financial instruments with business logic around specific events. They are not legal agreements per se as they do not invoke the legal system, yet. However, the software code does make the business logic agreement binding in that users of smart contracts are bound to action, automatically via self execution on the ledger. End of the day, the purpose must practically aspire to our current economic system and the power of the state, guaranteeing the validity of smart contracts through law. Thus the smart contract facilitates legal agreement, in whole (payment) or in part (a clause that is aware that someone died via checking a database in a life insurance contract). Further, the smart contract is in a way like arbitration -- we decide to be bound by it, but it is not legal, and it has the capacity for execution, enforcement or remedy."
