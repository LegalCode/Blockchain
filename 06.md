# 06 Proposed Definition: 
Blockchain is a secure distributed and transparent ledger system that allows for the submission, verification, reversal, and retrieval of digital transactions. 	

## Reasons and Context for this Proposal: 
Blockchain is a secure distributed transparent ledger system that allows for the submission, verification, reversal, and retrieval of digital transactions. 
The interaction with the Blockchain shall be with an approved client or interface to (APIs) capable of verifying the identity of the person(s) for that interaction

	1) Secure: Blockchains shall be secured with no less than current industry standard for secure transactions
		a. Information within the Blockchain may also be encrypted over and above the parent encryption

	2) Distributed: The Blockchain shall not be controlled/governed by any monopoly or duopoly
		a. Less than 25% of any Blockchain participating hosts shall reside within the same physical building
		b. Less than 25% of the Blockchain participating hosts shall be controlled by any single entity (Person, Corp, Government).

	3) Transparent:  The Blockchain while in an encrypted format shall be viewable in that format in its entirety.
		a. The Blockchain itself shall be in an encrypted format fully decipherable by those with the keys to do so in whole or in parts they are authorized
		b.  The Blockchain may use different encryptions within the chain depending on uses
		c. The end user may use multiple Blockchains to store parts of the same data sets as long as they all conform to the rules of Blockchain

	4) Submission: The Blockchain shall allow for submission via a client and/or APIs of both encrypted and non-encrypted data
		a. The Blockchain client/APIs shall encrypt the submission in a manner digestible by other approved Blockchain clients providing transparency
		b. Submissions to the Blockchain must also be signed by the actual entity submitting the data.
			i. This digital signature must be verifiable via digital means
			ii. This digital signature must include the on behalf of (Government, Corp, Person) in the signature hierarchy

	5) Verification: Any single transaction on the Blockchain shall be verifiable digitally for its authenticity
		a. Each Node, Client, User, shall Provide/Be Provided a unique identifier
			i. This (in its public form) shall be provided to the nodes on the Blockchain
			ii. Clients/Users may have more than one unique identifier for roles based uses cases
			iii. Proof of authenticity must be provided if:
				1)  The validity is challenged by 25% or more of the clients in the Blockchain
				2) The identifier is changed and identity transferred
				3) The Client/User applies for an additional unique identifier
		b. Each Transaction shall have a unique identification.
			i. In the case of duplicate transaction IDs:
				1) The first as decided by the Blockchain shall be accepted
				2) The subsequent Transactions will be logged and flagged as reversals
				3) Clients/users will be notified of the Blockchain's decision via review of the Blockchain

	6) Reversal: Blockchain transactions may be reversed up to 60 min from time of submission
		a. Submission of a reversal must happen within 30 min from the 60 min window
		b. Submission of a reversal transaction must follow the same rules as a new transaction
			i. Must also include identification of original transaction
		c. No reversal shall occur without an offsetting original transaction 
				
	7) Retrieval: Blockchain transactions shall be retrievable by:
		a. Any non-encrypted clear text data once the ledger is decrypted
		b. The unique identifier of
			i. Node
			ii. Client
			iii. Country
			iv. Corp
			v. User
		c. Date / time 
			i. Down to the second of such date/time
			ii. Dates and times are in UTC
