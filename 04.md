# 04 Proposed Definition: 
The term ‘smart contract’ means a contract or a term in a contract that provides for automatic performance of the requirements of such terms by an electronic agent or agents, including electronic agents that use blockchain technology, upon the performance (by an electronic agent or otherwise) of the requirements of another term in the contract or the occurrence of another event specified in the contract.

## Reasons and Context for this Proposal: 
Collaborated with Joey Krug, a blockchain leader that is the co-founder of Augur and a 2016 Thiel Fellow on the shared definition.
