# Proposed Definition 02: 
A Blockchain is the construct of a derived set of immutable sequential structures which prove and existence (real or virtual) of structures and their relations at a time and/or space. Such structures may take the form of the computable medium- be it biologic, mathematic, binary etc.

## Reasons and Context for this Proposal: 
It is clear that a definition blockchains as a means of means of proof of identity and authorization must extend into (future) bio-computational systems.
