# Proposed Definition 08: 
A shared record of verifiable truth	

## Reasons and Context for this Proposal: 
Many people are calling things a "blockchain" that does not chain blocks and does not resemble bitcoin.  They are still however, useful, novel and different to traditional databases.  What's more it's become a catch all term including "smart contracts" - which could also be considered "distributed compute" which can be hugely helpful in enterprise settings.  See "Distributed Ledger - Beyond Blockchain" by UK Gov Office for Science for more detail.
